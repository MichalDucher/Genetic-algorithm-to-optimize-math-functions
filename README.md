#Genetic Algorithm for Binary-Coded Optimization

This is a Java implementation of a genetic algorithm for binary-coded optimization. The algorithm can be used to optimize a function with two variables, represented as binary strings.

Usage
To use this algorithm, simply run the Main class. The algorithm is currently set up to optimize the function -x1^2 - x2^2 + 2, where x1 and x2 are the two variables being optimized.

The algorithm can be customized by changing the values of the n, d, a, and b variables in the main method. These variables control the number of genes in each chromosome (n), the number of decimal places for each gene (d), and the range of values for each gene (a and b).
